# PyBer Analysis
## *Analyze Rideshare Data from January to Early May 2019*
### Project Overview: Use Pandas and Matplotlib to asses the number of riders, drivers and fares by type of city, to help improve rider access to rideshares and affordability.

## Results 
PyBer tasked us with exploring rideshare data from 2019 to address disparities among city types: urban, suburban and rural.
</br>
Expectedly, urban areas produced the most rides, had the most drivers, and grossed the most in sales or total fares out of the three city types.

Fare per ride and average fare per driver was lowest in urban areas. Inversely, rural cities had the fewest number of rides, drivers, and sales or total fares, but the highest tickets per ride, and highest average fare per driver.

Suburban cities clocked in at second on all metrics: total rides, drivers and fares, and average fare per ride and fare per driver.  To give a little perspective to these numbers, urban cities had 171% more rides, 187% more drivers, and 161% more in total fares than it's rural counterparts, but 34% less in average fare per ride and 108% less in average fare per driver.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
## Summary

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Likely due to the short distances between pick-ups and drop-offs, the average fare per ride and fare per driver was the lowest for urban areas.
